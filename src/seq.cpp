/*! \brief Initialize the map of read types and their names
 *
 *  The goal of read type names is to indicate the reason why a read was
 *  filtered. The name contains the filter type and threshold which allows for
 *  obtaining statistics on the filtered reads. The threshold
 *  values are specified in the function arguments.
 *
 *  \param[in]  length  the minimum read length
 *  \param[in]  polyG   the minimum length of a polyG region in a read
 *  \param[in]  dust_k  this value is related to the *DustMasker* algorithm
 *  \param[in]  dust_cutoff this value is related to the *DustMasker* algorithm
 *
 *  \remark The DustMasker algorithm is described in the following paper:
 *  Morgulis, Aleksandr, E. Michael Gertz, Alejandro A. Sch√§ffer, and Richa
 *  Agarwala. "A fast and symmetric DUST implementation to mask low-complexity
 *  DNA sequences." *Journal of Computational Biology* 13, no. 5 (2006): 1028-1040.
